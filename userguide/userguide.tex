\section{Introduction}

The rationale for using this is to easily get Debian systems up and running, repeatedly. I have personally gone through the graphical installer tens (if not hundreds) of times. Because of this, I feel the need to get a basic script going that can replicate my settings on a repeated basis. 

I've blown up enough systems trying to install some tweak and then not been able to figure out how to get it back. Hopefully, this can help. 

\section{What it Does}

The script automates the installation of packages, configs, DEs, etc. This is after the initial installation.
